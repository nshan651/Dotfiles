Please see the attached code files.  You need to flesh out the methods in MyLinkedList.java that I have given the skeleton code for.  After you do that, I would like you to do a mini project with MyBigInteger where you will implement ways to store and manipulate integers of any size using MyLinkedList.  Submit only the two completed code files MyLinkedList and MyBigInteger as separate java files.  Don't zip them.   Get started early!
